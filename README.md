In this SQL project, using the bill table, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to moderate SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset

I removed a few fields that unnecessary for this analysis, and renamed the excel file.

I then came up with questions regarding the datasets and proceeded to execute the query.

I used MS-SQL Server and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
